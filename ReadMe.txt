In order to build this application you will need to have Visual Studio and NUnit 3 Test Adapters. 
Once you open the application, you can just click build.

After it builds successfully, then you can click Run All to run all the unit tests. If the test explorer window is not available
you can find it under Test --> Windows

Keep in mind that if you don't install NUnit 3 Test Adapters then you will not see any tests. 
All NUnit dependencies were added through NuGet, so you shouldn't have an issue running them.
